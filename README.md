The primary goal of this assignment is to practice using Github.

We're providing a simple python script that needs to be debugged.
Your challenge is to fix the code so that it runs correctly and generates the correct
output. The program itself can tell you when it's working, you just need to correct
the problems throughout the code. Once the errors are removed, the code will generate
a text file that is compared to a baseline. If they match, the program reports "True"
after a successful run. 

## How You're Graded
1. Demonstrate the ability to clone a github project.
2. Demonstrate the ability to read python code, identify and fix trivial bugs.
3. Demonstrate the ability to check your code back into the github.

Programming tip: Good programs work. Great programs are easy to read, self-evident, well-documented,
and well-tested. Consider this a hint.
